# citiBikeTableau
### In this project, I took New York City's CitiBike data from the month of March in 2014-2018. This was done to make the data easier to work with while still getting 3.5 million records and showing changes in CitiBike usage over time.
### Data cleaning was done in the attached Jupyter Notebook. Here some fields were changed and columns were added for clarity.
### Tableau workbook was pushed to Github using Git Large File Storage.
